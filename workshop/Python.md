# Utilizing openrouteservice with Python: A Disaster use case scenario

Welcome to the comprehensive training guide on using openrouteservice with Python, a powerful combination for geospatial analysis and routing. This guide is divided into three parts, each focusing on different aspects of openrouteservice integration with Python. By following these resources, you will learn how to leverage openrouteservice for **routes/directions, isochrone analysis, and routing optimization**, with a particular emphasis on disaster-aware routing scenarios such as the Ahr Valley flood in Germany in 2021 and the logistics routing problem in the aftermath of Cyclone Idai in Mozambique in 2019.

**Part 1: Part 1 - Disaster aware routing with openrouteservice**
In this section, you will learn how to utilize openrouteservice in Python to calculate routes and directions. We will explore how to incorporate the openrouteservice API into your Python scripts, focusing on disaster-aware routing to respond effectively to emergency situations such as the Ahr Valley flood. The resources provided will guide you through the process of accessing and interpreting route data, enabling you to make informed decisions for efficient and optimized routing.

**Part 2 - Disaster aware isochrones with openrouteservice**
This part delves into the application of openrouteservice with Python for isochrone analysis. Rather than focusing on point-to-point routes, we will explore how to generate reachable areas and understand how flood-affected infrastructure can impact these areas. The resources will walk you through the steps of calculating isochrones, visualizing the results, and extracting meaningful insights to aid in decision-making and disaster response planning.

**Part 3 - Optimizing logistics in disaster situations**
In the final section, we will address the challenges of routing optimization using openrouteservice and Python. Through a practical scenario centered around the aftermath of Cyclone Idai in Mozambique, we will demonstrate how to solve logistics routing problems efficiently. By applying optimization techniques, you will learn how to streamline routes, allocate resources effectively, and make informed decisions to support relief efforts in disaster-stricken areas.
