# Resources

Throughout this tutorial, we will make use of various datasets. You can access these from a [shared web drive](https://heibox.uni-heidelberg.de/d/9f1c43601ad2475f843b/). To 
access this drive, you will need a password which will be provided in the tutorial session.

* openrouteservice API key
* Glasgow OSM data file
* NetAScore prepared dataset for Glasgow
* csv file containing mapped walk and bikeability index to OSM ways

Software is also available open source from GitHub, which you will need to pull locally if you want to experiment with the services themselves:

* openrouteservice - [https://github.com/GIScience/openrouteservice](https://github.com/GIScience/openrouteservice)
* NetAScore - [https://github.com/plus-mobilitylab/netascore](https://github.com/plus-mobilitylab/netascore)

To complete most of the tutorials, you will also need some software installed on your system. Predominantly these are:

* [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html)
* [Docker and Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
